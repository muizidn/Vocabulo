        data-attribute-index="0" data-entity-type="MINI_COMPANY">Softr</a> - the fastest-growing no-code startup in
    Europe, is looking to bring its first Marketing leader to help take Softr to the next level!<br><br>What is
    Softr?&nbsp;<br>Softr - the easiest no-code platform to build business apps powered by your data (Airtable, Gsheet,
    more). <br><br>Why should you care?&nbsp; <br>The world runs on code; everything around us that uses tech is built
    by developers. But only 0.3% of the world’s population knows how to code - 1 out of every 400 people. Imagine what
    would have happened if only 1 in 400 people knew how to read and write. <br><br>Softr is changing that, and with its
    most intuitive and powerful platform, it's on a vision to bring software building to every individual in business
    and life. <br><br>Why is this one of the most exciting and impactful opportunities for the best marketers to help
    shape the future of no-code?&nbsp;<br>- “Product of the Year 2021” in ProductHunt (alongside ChatGPT, Figma and
    others in history)<br><br>- Horizontal product in all sense (use cases and ICPs) -&nbsp;with a powerful PLG GTM
    motion - unlimited market potential and interesting challenges not typical to your average vertical solution
    <br><br>- Organic growth to 200K users &lt;2 years, through product, WOM, and a huge and passionate community.
    <br><br>- Many of the world’s top product, growth and community operators believe and joined Softr’s vision - like
    Elena Verna, Scott Belsky, Brian Balfour, Gokul Rajaram to name a few (yours truly is also a small investor, but a
    huge fan)<br>&nbsp;<br>Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/softr/" data-attribute-index="2"
